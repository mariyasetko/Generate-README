# README-Generator

## Description

-I created this project to dynamically generate comprehensive README.md files. 
-This project will be a great time saver for myself and my fellow developers.
-Building a README at the end of my projects is one of my least favourite things - why not make it painless.
-I learned how to work with inquirer and fs, specifically "prompt" and "writeToFile".
